- Local setup and quick testing: `docs/local-run.md`
- FAQ and common errors: `docs/faq.md`
- Glossary of terms: `docs/glossary.md`

## Repository structure

- `openapi.yml` — API specification
- `docs/` — assignment documentation (what to implement and how it is evaluated)
- `examples/` — request/DSL examples (not required to complete the assignment)
